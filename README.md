ViewModel and ViewModelFactory - Starter Code
==================================

Use as starter code for the ViewModel codelab.

Introduction
------------

This starter app is a two player game, GuessTheWord. It is a word guessing app you can play with one or more friends. To play, hold the device in landscape, facing away from you with your thumbs on the **Skip** and **Got It** buttons. Your friends can then give you clues to help you guess the word. If you get the word right, press **Got It**. If you're stuck, press **Skip**.
You will modify the app to use Architecture components and best practices.
